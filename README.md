# Geometry Calculator App

This is an interactive web application which solves a variety of geometry problems and displays the solutions on a frontend. The application utilizes the Flask framework in Python along with HTML and CSS for the frontend. The backend and solving is all handled through Javescript functions which leverage `Math` and conditional statements.

## How to Run

In order to run the application on a localhost instance, the user will need to create a "templates" folder within their project folder where in which they will place all of the HTML files. They will then also place the flask python file separately into the project folder. The project can then either be run directly on the machine's terminal by simply running the flask python file (ensuring that they are in the project folder directory) or it can be opened in an IDE and run from an integrated terminal.

Once initialized, the user can navigate to their browser and open the localhost instance on which the application is running. On the homescreen, the user can hover over the menu button and select a geometry problem to solve.
